    <p> Richer and creamier than most store-bought varieties,

    <p> Our secret ingredient is amped-up vanilla extract (with flecks from the vanilla bean included!). </p>

<h2> Ingredients </h2>
<body>
    <p> <ul> 
        <li> 1 cup milk </li>
        <li> 1/2 cup granulated sugar </li>
        <li> 2 cups heavy cream </li>
        <li> 1 tsp vanilla </li>
        <li> 15 oreo cookies </li>
    </ul> </p>

<h2> Steps to create the <strong> COOKIES AND CREAM ICE CREAM </strong> </h2>
<body>
    <p> <ol>
        <li> Whisk together the milk and sugar, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. </li>
        <li> Stir in the heavy cream and vanilla. </li>
        <li> For best results, chill the mixture in the refrigerator for 1 hour before freezing. </li>
        <li> Freeze in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's directions. </li>
        <li> Stir the cookie chunks into the soft ice cream, and serve immediately. </li>
        <li> For firmer ice cream, place soft ice cream in a covered container. Freeze for 2 to 3 hours, until the ice cream is as hard as you like. 
            Note: Freezing longer than this will make the ice cream rock hard; plan on softening at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes or so before serving.</li>
    </ol> </p>
