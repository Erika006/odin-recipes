            <h2> Steps to create the <span> <strong> COOKIES AND CREAM ICE CREAM </strong> </span> </h2>
            <p> <ol class = "list">
                <li> Whisk together the milk and sugar, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. </li>
                <li> Stir in the heavy cream and vanilla. </li>
                <li> For best results, chill the mixture in the refrigerator for 1 hour before freezing. </li>
                <li> Freeze in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's directions. </li>
                <li> Stir the cookie chunks into the soft ice cream, and serve immediately. </li>
                <li> For firmer ice cream, place soft ice cream in a covered container. Freeze for 2 to 3 hours, until the ice cream is as hard as you like. 
                Note: Freezing longer than this will make the ice cream rock hard; plan on softening at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes or so before serving.</li>
