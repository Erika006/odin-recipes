# odin-recipes reflection
 This project is going to be building a simple receipt website. MAY NOT BE PRETTY but we are just getting the jizz of building one.

22 June 2024
First project on Odin here to create a website stating the different types of recipes available to follow. Some difficulties was to remember the different element tags for each line that i wish to input into the heading, body etc and also including pages with different links and recipes.
It became a bit complicated after typing out a series of codes but i somewhat got used to it after awhile.
